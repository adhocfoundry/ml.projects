### Machine Learning: Project 001
## Housing Simple Regression - Multivariate

#### Overview

Understanding the data is the most difficult and time-consuming thing in data science.
Following steps are essential even before we jump into model training.

1. **Understand the problem**: We'll look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.
2. **Univariable study**: We'll just focus on the dependent variable ('SalePrice') and try to know a little bit more about it.
3. **Multivariate study**: We'll try to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.
4. **Basic cleaning**: We'll clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.
5. **Test assumptions** We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.
